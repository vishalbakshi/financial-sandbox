I intentionally used none, some, most or all of the ideas and concepts from the resources listed in this file.
Uninentionally, I have probably gleaned and conflated concepts they benevolently introduced, so if you're wondering "wait, why did he do this?" this explains why.

In general, when working with React I try to find examples that align with these ideas:

<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html" target="_blank">Thinking In React</a>

Additionally, Dan Abramov started his own blog recently, and I am generally interested in and inspired by most things he has to say about web development:

<a href="https://overreacted.io/" target="_blank">Overreacted</a>

Some of the content is not beginner-friendly, as he disclaims from the start of <a href="https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/" target="_blank">this article</a>, but he is still able to impart meaningful concepts that helped my understanding
of React even during the duration of this project. 

Some nuggets:

<blockquote>I like to think of React elements as being like frames in a movie. They capture what the UI should look like at a specific point in time. They donâ€™t change.</blockquote>
